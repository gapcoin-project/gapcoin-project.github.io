There were 551 record gaps in the file sent.

Gapcoin went from 755 total records to 1241, a gain of 486. The difference is because of breaking its own records.

Gapcoin had 1614 records on 27 Dec 2015 right after submitting. Itâ€™s been dropping every month as records have been broken by others. Those tend to be the lowest merits however.
