There are only [a few gaps left](https://primegaps.cloudygo.com/graphs?max=80000) for some nice numeric limits.

- only 4 gaps < 20,000 with merit < 25 (2894, 15122, 19246, 19352)
- only 6 gaps < 50,000 with merit < 20 (36574, 38162, 42752, 49246, 49298, 49646)
- only 1 gap < 80,000 with merit < 15 (78542)
- only 6 gaps < 100,000 with merit < 12 (95278, 96638, 98002, 98122, 98818, 99418)

I'm curious if people would have fun if I donated a small prize pool for these and some other records (the \~10 missing gaps below 125,000, new gaps with merit > 35, mega gaps > 2M) maybe $5 per gap + $10 for finishing each range and maybe adding a small listing to the prime list site of "people who helped close out ranges"?

Any advice + input from the larger GIMPS community about offering small rewards would be appreciated.
