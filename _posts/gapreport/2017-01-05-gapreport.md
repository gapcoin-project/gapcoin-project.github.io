The web page is working again, thanks to whoever got it going again.

Gapcoin just got a new top 20 record, with a merit of 34.66, for the number 16 spot.

In December 2014, Gapcoin first made it on the top 20 list with two gaps of merit 33.32 and 33.08 (number 13 and 20 respectively). It peaked in May 2015 with positions 11, 14, 18, and 19 with merits 33.49, 33.32, 33.27, and 33.27. The bottom two dropped off the top 20 list in October 2015, and in June 2016 Gapcoin didn’t have any top 20 merit gaps. At the start of 2017 it takes a merit of 34.52 to get on the top-20 list, and Gapcoin’s second highest merit (the 33.49 that was at one time #11) is now number 55.
