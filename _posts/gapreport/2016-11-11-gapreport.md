It seems whatever process had been updating the results ([http://gapcoin.org/primegaps-length.php](http://gapcoin.org/primegaps-length.php)) has stopped. Nothing has changed for almost a month.

I’m not sure if the dump file on the downloads page is more recent, but it had more records. 146 new gaps were submitted to Dr. Nicely’s site. The overall number of Gapcoin records has been going down a little in the last two months as others have broken records.
