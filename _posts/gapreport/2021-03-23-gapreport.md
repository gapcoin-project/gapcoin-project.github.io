##### 2021-03-23, 16:10 Prime gap list updated

I used Seth Troisi’s cool [online service](https://primegaps.cloudygo.com/) (described in more detail in the [update post “New Front End”](/gapcoin/2020/03/05/gapreport/)) to submit (for checking and adding) the candidate Gapcoin record prime gaps for the whole of 2020 - [no new first occurrence prime gaps but 62 improved merits](https://github.com/primegap-list-project/prime-gap-list/commit/b2e24b423de8b27a2934092e5a1460ac874ff40e) and for 2021 thus far, again [no new first occurrence prime gaps but 25 improved merits](https://github.com/primegap-list-project/prime-gap-list/commit/0a8ccbea250ce94c4abfc6b3ad2be3c43db06d23).

At the time of posting, Gapcoin has 1093 entries in the prime gap list.
