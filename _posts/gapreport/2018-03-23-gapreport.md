##### 2018-03-23, 21:52:55 New prime gap of maximum known merit


I want to confirm that Gapcoin broke the World Record for the largest known prime gap of maximum merit:

<blockquote><p>NEW PRIME GAP OF MAXIMUM KNOWN MERIT<br/>
The Gapcoin network (Jonnie Frey, developer), a Bitcoin derivative which employs a hashing algorithm to search for prime gaps of high merit, has discovered a new prime gap of maximum known merit, a gap of <tt>G=8350</tt> following the 87-digit prime <math>P1=293703234068022590158723766104419463425709075574811762098588798217895728858676728143227</math>.<br/>The merit <math>M=G/ln(P1)</math> of this gap is <math>M=41.93878373153988</math>, the largest merit of any known prime gap, and the first prime gap to be discovered with a merit exceeding 40. The endpoints of the gap have been certified as primes deterministically, using the Akiyama-Kida-O'Hara UBASIC implementation (1988-1992) of the APRCL2 test, due to Adleman, Pomerance, Rumely, Cohen, H. W. Lenstra, and A. K. Lenstra (1984-1987).

</blockquote>

The current bounty for the World Record of 50,000 GAP goes out to the mining address of the 41.9 merit Gap GJtsALGXvATz8DEakokLDQRa9dF49AFt7F which seems to belong to Andrey Balyakin.

So thanks and congratulation Andrey Balyakin, for mining the World Record prime gap.
