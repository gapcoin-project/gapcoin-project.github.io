Graph by Seth Troisi showing coverage and different contributions

Seth notes:

“I also added a weighted average line to <a href="https://primegaps.cloudygo.com/graphs?max=70000" target="_blank">the merit plot on cloudygo</a> and min_x, max_x input.

You can see where the focused efforts from gapcoin & S.Troisi have increased average merit in the neighborhood of 5000-6000 and 45000-52000”
