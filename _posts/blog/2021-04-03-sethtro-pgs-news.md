Craig has continued with small gaps improving several hundred records <12000. 

Including this new top 20 merit gap as well as many other top 100 / top 200 merit gaps.

```10470 36.3971 Craig Loizides 29052706830863*277#/30-5748```

David Stevens cleared one more gap from [#227](https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=571747&postcount=227)

```95278 12.1047 DStevens 9301541 * 7993#/505915410 -44226```

I (Seth) filled in even more of the #2221 primorial line

Michiel Jansen found a few more of the missing gaps < 125,000 (only 13 missing now)


*technically "more records have this year as discovery than last year" so maybe 20% fewer but IDK.*
